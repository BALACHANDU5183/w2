      <h1>Excess Use of Electronic Gadgets</h1>
      <p>It can impact the mental health of children in all age groups from infants to adolescents. It can lead to delayed speech, hyperactivity, aggression, violence, desire for instant gratification, fear of missing out, fear of being left out, cyberbullying, distorted perception of sex by exposure to pornography, cyberbullying, drug use, self-harm, anxiety, and depression. Not only does the excessive screen exposure impact the mental health but it indirectly also impacts the physical wellbeing. Some of the ill effects on physical effects observed are obesity, sedentary lifestyle, disturbed sleep, eye strain, neck, back and wrist pain. Reduced socialization, social anxiety and decreased academic performance are some additional ill effects of prolonged screen exposure seen on children which has indirect effects on the mental health of an individual.</p>
      
      <p>Social interaction is vital for a child's healthy development. Online platforms that are used by children and adolescents to connect with friends and family, share media content, and form social networks constitutes the social media. Some of the popular platforms include Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and skype. In recent time, online multiplayer games, such as PUBG and Clash of Clans, are popular social media spaces for young people, where they connect and chat with other gamers while playing. While there are advantages to social media like helps create social support group, advocacy platform and helps in collaborative learning it has a flip side to it.</p>
      
      <p>Parents must always reassure children that they love them and will be available for help in all situations. Lastly teaching them rules of “digital hygiene” are important. Balance use of screen time, correct posture to be adapted while sitting, frequent breaks to reduce eyestrains are some easy steps to follow. Keep children safe by co viewing and monitoring online content. Lastly Parents are the role models so modelling the right digital practices for children can be the first step towards teaching the right digital practices. Let us together reduce unhealthy media use to prevent upcoming mental health conditions like internet addictions.</p>

      <h1>Health Awareness</h1>
      <p>Good health is essential for every human being. Health information is essential for maintaining good health, preventing diseases as well as making sound health decisions. People can only be able to access, utilize, and benefit from healthcare services if they have proper information about these services. It is here that health information literacy comes into play. The information related to every aspect of health is easily available today, but the main problem here lies in finding, selecting, and using relevant health information and preventing misinformation. Libraries have a pivotal role to play here. This chapter is mainly concerned with identifying the gaps in the provision of health information to the general public and the role of health information literacy in paving the way of filling up these gaps. It will be helpful in knowing the current standing of public and medical libraries in providing health information resources and services. It will also suggest the role of these libraries of India in promoting health information literacy among their respective user communities.</p>
